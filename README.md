# Some Logic Errors üòÖ

- Add Book
Errors with Adding new Book, i don't know how to add input for file, because 
all the books source "pdf file" is store in public/books_source, So if needed
to add file, i have to download it, then put it in books_source, and then copy
the Path, but it very long and need backend, So Sorry 

- CSS
Not real error, but because of by navigation bar, i must to add margin-top to all my pages


# Conclusion

Despite all errors, it very useful project, so in feature i can built more complex project,
It Is Just Start ü¶æ
